# Identity API

This Laravel 13 application is the independently deployable API for [ZoltaSoft's Laravel Zolta Identity](https://github.com/zoltasoft/zolta-identity). Its `UserManagementService` slice provides authentication and account lifecycle, installation-user administration, social accounts, project access management, a reusable access catalog, confidential clients, rotating sessions, audit, and consumer introspection.

## Local setup

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
php artisan identity:bootstrap owner@example.com --name="Installation owner"
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8100
```

The bootstrap secret is shown once and belongs only to the Nuxt Identity Console BFF.

Requirements are PHP 8.3+, Composer 2, and SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. For a repeatable local setup after cloning, `composer setup` installs dependencies, creates `.env` and the SQLite database when absent, generates the application key, and runs migrations. Run `identity:bootstrap` separately so its one-time credentials can be stored deliberately.

## API groups

- `/api/auth/*`: authentication and account-lifecycle endpoints
- `/api/users/*`: installation-level user administration protected by Laravel system-administrator enforcement
- `/api/v1/identity/auth/*`: register, login, credentialless sandbox sessions, refresh, introspect, current identity, sessions, and logout
- `/api/v1/identity/projects/*`: projects, live/sandbox settings, clients, permission manifests, roles, permissions, reusable access catalog, invitations, memberships, cleanup webhooks, and audit events
- `/api/v1/identity/users/*`: installation-level user administration
- `/api/v1/identity/invitations/accept`: invitation acceptance

Management endpoints require a project-scoped Sanctum access token. System-wide user management requires a system administrator. Project changes require either that state or an active project-administrator membership.

## Token rules

- access-token TTL: `IDENTITY_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES`, default 15 minutes
- refresh-token TTL: `IDENTITY_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS`, default 30 days
- invitation TTL: `IDENTITY_INVITATION_TTL_HOURS`, default 72 hours
- refresh tokens rotate atomically
- reuse of a rotated token revokes the complete refresh family and its access tokens
- disabling a client, locking a user, removing a membership, or changing relevant access invalidates affected authorization

## Verification

```bash
composer check
composer security:audit
php artisan route:list --path=api
php artisan route:list --path=api/v1/identity
```

Give the identity server its own database and deployment lifecycle. Consumer applications should store only their domain data and the global identity IDs needed to associate it with users.

Production webhook delivery requires an asynchronous queue worker. Webhook requests include `X-Identity-Event-Id`, `X-Identity-Event`, `X-Identity-Timestamp`, and `X-Identity-Signature`; the signature is `v1=` followed by HMAC-SHA256 of `<timestamp>.<raw-body>`. HTTPS is required in production and private destinations are rejected.
