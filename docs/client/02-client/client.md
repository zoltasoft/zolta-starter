# Client architecture

[← Client architecture index](index.md) · [↑ Nuxt architecture index](../index.md) · [Architecture home](../../api/index.md)

## Authentication and identity consumer

When the application uses `@zoltasoft/identity-consumer-nuxt`, keep hosted authentication and session handling in the auth layer/root session foundation. BFF routes use the server session helper and forward authenticated requests to upstream APIs. Client code consumes auth state and calls BFF routes; it does not store provider secrets or call the Identity Project directly.

For a custom identity provider, preserve the same boundary: a server session/auth helper resolves the principal, BFF routes enforce required permissions, and feature composables receive only the client-safe session state. Session expiry handling and CSRF protection are separate concerns.

## Client state and composable responsibilities

For a rich feature, use the jobs-style split:

```text
state.<feature>.ts    useState stores and default factories
query.<feature>.ts    reads, list/detail loading, state updates
actions.<feature>.ts  writes, locking, optimistic/local updates, errors
client.<feature>.ts   HTTP calls to /api/... only
store.<feature>.ts    readonly facade and derived state
model.<feature>.ts    domain-to-view composition
page.<feature>.ts     page-level orchestration
```

For simple CRUD/resource screens, an admin-style `useXxx` composable is acceptable. Keep pages thin: choose layout/middleware, obtain the page/model composable, and render components. Components emit intent or receive data/callbacks; they do not own upstream transport or cache policy.

## Nuxt ↔ Identity communication flow

When `@zoltasoft/identity-consumer-nuxt` is enabled, communication is server-mediated. The module registers no-store BFF endpoints for each configured application key:

```text
GET  /api/identity/<application>/auth/authorize
GET  /api/identity/<application>/auth/callback
GET  /api/identity/<application>/auth/session
POST /api/identity/<application>/auth/logout
GET  /api/identity/<application>/account/authorize
```

The login lifecycle is:

1. Browser calls `useZoltaIdentity('<application>').login(returnTo, intent)` or navigates to the authorize endpoint.
2. Nuxt stores a short-lived state transaction in an encrypted, HTTP-only cookie and redirects to hosted Identity.
3. Identity authenticates/registers the user and returns a short-lived handoff code plus state to the Nuxt callback.
4. Nuxt validates state, exchanges the code server-side, and stores the encrypted consumer session; tokens do not enter the browser URL.
5. `useZoltaIdentitySession().refresh()` calls the session endpoint and exposes only the public user profile to Vue.
6. A BFF route calls `requireIdentityUser(event, '<application>')` or `createIdentityApiClient(event, '<application>', options)` to obtain the current user/token and call the protected API.

```ts
// app/composables/useAuthenticationState.ts
export function useAuthenticationState() {
  const { csrf, headerName } = useCsrf()
  const identity = useZoltaIdentity('starter', {
    defaultRedirect: '/dashboard',
    loginPath: '/auth/login',
    logoutHeaders: () => ({ [headerName]: csrf })
  })

  return {
    user: identity.user,
    ready: identity.ready,
    login: identity.login,
    logout: identity.logout,
    refresh: identity.refresh
  }
}
```

On the server, `createIdentityApiClient` attaches the current access token, refreshes once after an upstream 401, retries once, and clears the consumer session if refresh fails. A browser-side `useZoltaIdentityFetch` can clear the session and begin login on 401; it must not turn 403 domain authorization failures into login redirects.

Configure a 32+ character session secret, hosted authentication URL, Identity API URL, confidential client credentials, registered callback URL, application key, cookie name, and local logout redirect in private runtime configuration. Use `SameSite=Lax`, `HttpOnly`, and `Secure` in production; reject unsafe external return paths.

## Authenticated mutations and CSRF

Every protected `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` uses the repository’s authenticated transport and CSRF convention:

```ts
const authenticatedFetch = useAuthenticatedFetch()
const { csrf, headerName } = useCsrf()

await authenticatedFetch('/api/tasks', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { [headerName]: csrf },
  body: input,
})
```

Do not use raw `$fetch` for authenticated mutations. Keep repeated transport in the feature client composable, handle session expiry centrally, and update/invalidate local state after the action completes.

## Resources, mapping, and data shape

BFF resources/mappers define client-facing types: singular resource, collection, pagination, empty state, acknowledgement, and error shapes. Normalize upstream data once in the BFF. The client should not know whether a field came from Laravel, an external provider, or a merged response. Use feature-shared types when both server and client need the same shape.

## Caching

Cache in the feature BFF service layer using root cache infrastructure. Build feature-local keys, scope user/session-sensitive data by the correct identity, cache normalized responses rather than raw upstream envelopes, and invalidate in the write service that owns the cached read. Never cache authorization-sensitive data under a global key.
