# Reference feature layer

## Jobs layer as the primary structural example

The reference `jobs` layer demonstrates a rich feature without putting its behavior in pages. Treat it as a structural example; copy the separation of concerns, not its product vocabulary or external provider.

### Client responsibility flow

`state` owns defaults, loading flags, pagination, selected item, and keyed errors. `query` owns reads, active query parameters, pagination, and stale-response protection. `actions` owns writes, in-flight locking, optimistic/local updates, and error capture. `client` owns only BFF calls and transport-body mapping. `store` exposes a readonly state facade plus explicit operations. `model` and `page` composables combine stores with route state, cookies, toasts, media queries, and lifecycle watchers.

A search can have two independent stores—provider results and saved user records—then synchronize them by stable external identity. A request sequence counter ensures an older response cannot overwrite a newer search. A keyed in-flight lock prevents duplicate save/update/delete operations for the same resource while allowing unrelated resources to mutate concurrently.

### Pages and components

Pages select layout/middleware, create the page model, coordinate route/query synchronization, and compose presentational components. They may own page-only concerns such as a selected tab, responsive drawer, or URL query. They should not build request bodies, call `$fetch` to upstream services, parse Laravel envelopes, or implement cache policy. Components render props and emit intent (`save`, `update`, `delete`, `select`, `loadMore`); they remain reusable and testable.

### BFF route and service flow

The jobs BFF separates each endpoint by HTTP method and resource (`index.get`, `index.post`, `[id].get`, `[id].put`, `[id].delete`, collection/summary routes, and provider-search routes). Routes validate schemas, require a session for protected operations, apply rate limits to expensive public searches, and delegate to feature services.

`job.client.service.ts` calls Laravel through the shared authenticated API client and translates `ZoltaApiError` into stable BFF errors. `job.mapper.ts` converts snake_case/server records into the feature’s client shape. `job.service.ts` owns orchestration: it can enrich a saved record from a cached provider record, filter saved records by external IDs, and coordinate multiple upstream calls. A provider service owns external search and provider-specific caching; it never leaks provider response shapes to the client.

### Merge and cache pattern

A provider-search BFF route may fetch public results, then—when a session exists—fetch the user’s saved records by external IDs and merge them into a request-local clone. Cache public provider results and individual normalized provider records with deterministic keys; never cache a session-enriched object under a public key. Invalidate feature-owned caches after writes, and scope user-sensitive keys by identity.

### Feature validation and mapping

Use Zod schemas for pagination bounds, enum states, optional fields, cross-field constraints, and normalized provider query flags. Use separate schemas for provider search, saved-list queries, create input, and update input. Map client forms into the BFF request body in `client` or a feature mapper, then map upstream records into the shared feature type in the BFF; each boundary owns its own naming and validation.
